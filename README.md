## 反动：马克思主义哲学认为，人类历史的发展存在着客观规律，社会形态总是在变革中不断进步，从原始形态往高级形态发展。反动，是指违背客观规律，反对进步、反对社会变革。
## 在某“社会主义”国家，不知从何时起，反动一词经常被误解为“反党、反国家、反政府”，这是极其错误的。

## Reactionary: Marxist philosophy holds that there are objective laws in the development of human history, and the social form is always progressing in the process of reform and revolution, developing from the primitive form to the advanced form. Reactionary means opposing progress and social change in violation of objective laws.
## Since some time ago, reactionary has often been misunderstood as "anti-party, anti-state or anti-government" in a certain "socialist" country, which is extremely wrong.
